# Personal Blog

This laravel project is part of the beginner level of the [Laravel Learning Roadmap](https://laraveldaily.com/roadmap-learning-path). Below you can find the project specification.

## The Task: Simple Personal Blog

You need to create a personal blog with just three pages:

- Homepage: List of articles
- Article page
- Some static text page like "About me"

Also, there should be a Login mechanism (but no Register) for the author to write articles:

- Manage (meaning, create/update/delete) categories
- Manage tags
- Manage articles
- For Auth Starter Kit, use Laravel Breeze (Tailwind) or Laravel UI (Bootstrap) - that starter kit will have some design, which is enough: the design is irrelevant for accomplishing the task

DB Structure:

- Article has title (required), full text (required) and image to upload (optional)
- Article may have only one category, but may have multiple tags
